- Separation of concerns - each class should have a single responsibility, so in that case the
CustomerService.cs is doing too much. It should delegate responsibilities like validation, age, calculation
and credit checking to other classes or methods
- Dependency injection - Instead of instantiating dependencies within methods, these should be injected
through the constructor
- Input validation
- Avoid magic strings and numbers, those should be enums or constants
- Repositories should use interfaces
